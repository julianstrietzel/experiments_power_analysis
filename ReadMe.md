## **The Influence of University Apparel on Stranger Interaction**

by: Julian Strietzel, Srisha Raj, William Kuchenbuch, Vetle Jahr 

This repository contains the data, analysis scripts, and supplementary materials for the research project titled *"The Influence of University Apparel on Stranger Interaction"*. The study investigates whether wearing university-branded merchandise can enhance social interactions among strangers on a college campus, using flyer acceptance rates as a proxy measure.
This work has been conducted as part of the course INFO 241: Experiments & Causal Inference, taught by Professor Alex Hughes at the School of Information at the University of California, Berkeley.

### **Background and Motivation**
Social integration in large universities is often challenging, with many students feeling isolated despite being surrounded by peers. Previous research highlights the role of shared identifiers, such as school pride or common experiences, in fostering a sense of belonging. This study explores whether university-branded clothing can serve as a subtle social cue to promote interaction between strangers. Specifically, we hypothesize that wearing university-branded apparel signals in-group identity, increasing the likelihood of strangers accepting flyers distributed by students.

### **Research Design**
To test this hypothesis, we conducted a randomized controlled trial at the University of California, Berkeley (UC Berkeley). Student flyer distributors alternated between wearing UC Berkeley-branded apparel (treatment condition) and neutral clothing (control condition). The primary outcome measure was the flyer acceptance rate, defined as the proportion of people who accepted flyers out of those approached. The study also explored contextual factors such as location and individual distributor effects.

### **Key Contributions**
- **Field Experimentation**: The project employs a real-world experimental setup to evaluate how visual signals of group membership influence social behavior.
- **Data-Driven Insights**: Through rigorous data collection and analysis, this study provides insights into the dynamics of campus engagement and social bonding.
- **Open Science**: All data and analysis scripts are made publicly available to ensure transparency and reproducibility.

### **Repository Structure**

Withing the exp_2 folder, you will find the following subdirectories:

```
[exp_2](exp_2)/
│
├── [raw_data](exp_2/raw_data) -> Data collected from the main experiment
├── [session_1](exp_2/session_1) -> Data from the first session of the main experiment
├── [session_2](exp_2/session_2) -> Data from the second session of the main experiment

```
On top of that, you will find the following data files:

```
exp_1_data_cleaned.csv -> Data collected from the pilot experiment
[exp_1_data_collection.csv](exp_1_data_collection.csv) -> Data collected from the pilot experiment

```

- **Data**: Raw and processed datasets from the pilot and main experiments.
- **Analysis Scripts**: Code used for statistical analyses, including regression models and power simulations.
- **Documentation**: Detailed descriptions of variables, experimental design, and methodologies.

This repository aims to contribute to the broader understanding of how subtle social cues like clothing can shape everyday interactions. We encourage researchers, educators, and practitioners to explore the data and build upon our findings.
